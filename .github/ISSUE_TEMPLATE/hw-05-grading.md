- `[_ / 5]` - Doesn't require reproduction: .md file is in repo, figures show up in the .md file on GitHub, no egregious errors requiring reproducing the entire analysis to be able to follow it.
- `[_ / 3]` - Code style: Line breaks after `|>` and `+`, spaces around operators, spaces after commas, lines not too long, etc.
- `[_ / 3]` - Code smell: Messy / unnecessarily complex code, difficult to follow, unaddressed warnings, etc.
- `[_ / 3]` - Quality and quantity of commits: No uninformative/nonsense text in commit messages, entire assignment not committed in a single commit.
- `[_ / 3]` - Reasonably sized figures.
- `[_ / 3]` - Font size, organization: No crazy large text for narrative, questions answered in order and identified, easy to follow.
